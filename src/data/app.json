Since the 1.7.0 version the app will also use Google device copy, if it's turned on in the device's and the app's settings.\n\n* Why do I advise to not install the app on an SD card?\nI follow Google's advice to block installing on an SD card apps that use widgets. This app uses widgets, which are like icons for the notes, and can be placed on a phone's home screen (for example).\n\n* Why is the permission for writing on SD card listed on the permissions list?\nIt's currently not used. It was an optional permission for cases when a backup copy was to be saved on the device. Play Store shows historical permissions, even if it's no longer in use by the app.\nPlease remember that the permission can be revoked at any moment by going into the app's settings. Also, the app will ask for the permission when needed.\n\nIf you have any additional questions, just contact me by email: notepad.free@outlook.com .\n\nThank you.\nArek",

You time your taps to pull off stylish jumps, midair spins, and wall jumps to gather coins and reach the goal!\n\nSuper Mario Run can be downloaded for free and after you purchase the game, you will be able to play all the modes with no additional payment required. You can try out all four modes before purchase: World Tour, Toad Rally, Remix 10, and Kingdom Builder.\n\n■World Tour\nRun and jump with style to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser’s clutches! \nTravel through plains, caverns, ghost houses, airships, castles, and more.\n\nClear the 24 exciting courses to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser, waiting in his castle at the end. There are many ways to enjoy the courses, such as collecting the 3 different types of colored coins or by competing for the highest score against your friends. You can try courses 1-1 to 1-4 for free.\n\nAfter rescuing Princess Peach, a nine-course special world, World Star, will appear.\n\n■Remix 10\nSome of the shortest Super Mario Run courses you'll ever play!\nThis mode is Super Mario Run in bite-sized bursts! You'll play through 10 short courses one after the other, with the courses changing each time you play. Daisy is lost somewhere in Remix 10, so try to clear as many courses as you can to find her!\n\n■Toad Rally\nShow off Mario’s stylish moves, compete against your friends, and challenge people from all over the world.\n\nIn this challenge mode, the competition differs each time you play.\nCompete against the stylish moves of other players for the highest score as you gather coins and get cheered on by a crowd of Toads. Fill the gauge with stylish moves to enter Coin Rush Mode to get more coins. If you win the rally, the cheering Toads will come live in your kingdom, and your kingdom will grow. \n\n■Kingdom Builder\nGather coins and Toads to build your very own kingdom.\n\nCombine different buildings and decorations to create your own unique kingdom. There are over 100 kinds of items in Kingdom Builder mode. If you get more Toads in Toad Rally, the number of buildings and decorations available will increase. With the help of the friendly Toads you can gradually build up your kingdom.\n\n■What You Can Do After Purchasing All Worlds\n\n・ All courses in World Tour are playable\nWhy not try out the bigger challenges and thrills available in all courses?\n\n・ Easier to get Rally Tickets\nIt's easier to get Rally Tickets that are needed to play Remix 10 and Toad Rally. You can collect them in Kingdom Builder through Bonus Game Houses and ? Blocks, by collecting colored coins in World Tour, and more.\n\n・ More playable characters\nIf you rescue Princess Peach by completing course 6-4 and build homes for Luigi, Yoshi, and Toadette in Kingdom Builder mode, you can get them to join your adventures as playable characters. They play differently than Mario, so why not put their special characteristics to good use in World Tour and Toad Rally?\n\n・ More courses in Toad Rally\nThe types of courses available in Toad Rally will increase to seven different types of courses, expanding the fun! Along with the new additions, Purple and Yellow Toads may also come to cheer for you.\n\n・ More buildings and decorations in Kingdom Builder\nThe types of buildings available will increase, so you'll be able to make your kingdom even more lively. You can also place Rainbow Bridges to expand your kingdom.\n\n・ Play Remix 10 without having to wait\nYou can play Remix 10 continuously, without having to wait between each game.\n\n*Internet connectivity required to play.

And one of the most popular ways of transport are trains.\nIn Idle Transport Trains you are the owner of a train station - you have to manage the income from your passengers and invest it wisely. Expand train tracks, upgrade trains and hire conductors. \n\nWelcome all travelers that arrive at the station and help them commute wherever they want to go: super mall, central station, factory, or winter hills. Each passenger has to buy the ticket - the more satisfied customers, the wealthier you will become. \n\nIn the beginning your train station has only one track. But don’t worry! If you manage your train station well, you will build more and more tracks and trails on which trains can ride smoothly.\n\nOf course you can’t manage everything by yourself - that’s why you need managers that will help you. Each manager provides different upgrade to your train. If you want trains to be faster - hire lead engineer. Need more capacity? Director conductor will take care of this task!\n\nUpgrade trains so they can be faster, more capacious and well - more expensive! This way you can earn, invest in your business and become next transport tycoon!",
